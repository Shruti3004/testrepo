## About

FOSSology is an open source license compliance software system and toolkit. As a toolkit, you can run license, copyright and export control scans from the command line. As a system, a database and web UI are provided to give you a compliance workflow. In one click you can generate an SPDX file or a ReadMe with all the copyrights notices from your software. FOSSology deduplication means that you can scan an entire distro, rescan a new version, and only the changed files will get rescanned. This is a big time saver for large projects.

## Overview

The UI Migration project is an effort focused on generating the new component-based architecture with the integration of the APIs. To make the project more **efficient** and **easily accessible**, an entire code base shift from Symfony-Twig to React.js is proposed. React.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. React.js component system will enable us to organize the current working APIs appropriately.

## Objectives

- Working on good interactive design, with a modern look.
- Integrating the APIs to the new component-based UI structure.
- Seamless routing and page transitions.
- Giving the power of the node engine to our UI. Making all NPM accessible.
- Writing detailed â€‹ documentation of the project, to make the
  codebase simpler for other contributors.


## Requirements
NodeJS and NPM<br>
[https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn`
#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
